Histograms in Matplotlib
A histogram is a type of plot that shows the distribution of a dataset. It’s especially useful for visualizing the frequency of numerical data within specified ranges (called bins).

Why and When to Use Histograms?
Use histograms when:

You want to understand the distribution of a numerical dataset (e.g. age, salary, views).
You want to detect skewness, outliers, or understand spread.
You’re binning continuous data into intervals.
Examples include:

Analyzing the age of your YouTube viewers
Understanding test scores distribution
Checking if data is normally distributed
Understanding the bins Argument
The bins argument controls how the data is grouped:

If an integer, it defines the number of equal-width bins.
If a list, it defines custom bin edges, allowing you to control the range and width of each bin.
plt.hist(data, bins=10)  # 10 equal-width bins
plt.hist(data, bins=[10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 100])  # Custom age bins

edgecolor for Better Visibility
The edgecolor parameter adds borders to the bars, improving clarity:

plt.hist(data, bins=10, edgecolor='black')

Example: Age Distribution of YouTube Viewers
Here is age data for some viewers:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
 
ages = [
    34, 28, 36, 45, 27, 27, 45, 37, 25, 35,
    25, 25, 32, 10, 12, 24, 19, 33, 20, 15,
    44, 27, 30, 15, 24, 31, 18, 33, 23, 27,
    23, 48, 29, 19, 38, 17, 32, 10, 16, 31,
    37, 31, 28, 26, 15, 22, 25, 40, 33, 12,
    33, 26, 23, 36, 40, 39, 21, 26, 33, 39,
    25, 28, 18, 18, 38, 43, 29, 40, 33, 23,
    33, 45, 29, 45, 3, 38, 30, 27, 30, 10,
    27, 33, 44, 24, 21, 24, 39, 33, 24, 35,
    30, 39, 22, 26, 26, 15, 32, 32, 30, 27
]
 
bins = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
 
plt.hist(ages, bins=bins, edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Age Distribution of YouTube Viewers')
plt.xlabel('Age Group')
plt.ylabel('Number of Viewers')
plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
plt.show()

Adding a Vertical Line: axvline
Use axvline to mark a specific value like the average age or a threshold.

plt.hist(ages, bins=bins, edgecolor='black')
plt.axvline(np.mean(ages), color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label='Average Age')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Age Distribution with Mean Line')
plt.show()
