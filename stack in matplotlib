Stack Plots in Matplotlib
Let's Start with a Pie Chart
Before we understand what a stack plot is, let’s visualize some simple data

Imagine you surveyed how a group of students spends their after-school time:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
activities = ['Studying', 'Playing', 'Watching TV', 'Sleeping']
time_spent = [3, 2, 2, 5]  # hours in a day
 
colors = ['skyblue', 'lightgreen', 'gold', 'lightcoral']
 
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
plt.pie(time_spent, labels=activities, colors=colors, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
plt.title("After School Activities")
plt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle.
plt.show()

Interpretation:
Studying: 3 hours
Playing: 2 hours
Watching TV: 2 hours
Sleeping: 5 hours
This pie chart shows how a single student spends time in one day.

What is a Stack Plot?
Now, let’s imagine you surveyed multiple days, and you want to track how the time spent on each activity changes over a week.

A Stack Plot is a type of area chart that helps visualize multiple quantities over time, stacked on top of each other. It's especially useful to see how individual parts contribute to a whole over time.

Use Cases:
Time spent on different activities over days
Distribution of tasks by team members over a project timeline
Website traffic sources over a week
Stack Plot Example
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
days = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  # Days of the week
studying = [3, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4]
playing = [2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2]
watching_tv = [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]
sleeping = [5, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 5]
 
labels = ['Studying', 'Playing', 'Watching TV', 'Sleeping']
colors = ['skyblue', 'lightgreen', 'gold', 'lightcoral']
 
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.stackplot(days, studying, playing, watching_tv, sleeping,
              labels=labels, colors=colors, alpha=0.8)
 
plt.legend(loc='upper left')  # Location of the legend
plt.title('Weekly Activity Tracker')
plt.xlabel('Day')
plt.ylabel('Hours')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

Key Parameters in stackplot()
Parameter	Description
x	The x-axis data (like days)
*args	Multiple y-values (like studying, playing, etc.)
labels	Labels for the legend
colors	List of colors for each stack
alpha	Transparency level (0 to 1)
loc (in legend)	Position of the legend ('upper left', 'best', etc.)
